# Cmake

## About Cmake
Cmake is cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software in a compiler-independent manner

Unlike many cross-platform systems, CMake is designed to be used in conjunction with the native build environment.
Simple configuration files placed in each source directory (called CMakeLists.txt files) are used to generate standard
build files (e.g., makefiles on Unix and projects/workspaces in Windows MSVC) which are used in the usual way. CMake can
generate a native build environment that will compile source code, create libraries, generate wrappers and build
executables in arbitrary combinations. CMake supports in-place and out-of-place builds, and can therefore support
multiple builds from a single source tree. CMake also supports static and dynamic library builds.

CMake is designed to support complex directory hierarchies and applications dependent on several libraries.

CMake can also handle situations where executables must be built in order to generate code that is then compiled and
linked into a final application
